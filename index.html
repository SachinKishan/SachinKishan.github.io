                            <strong>Why open source? </strong><br>
                            My undergraduate institution had very little games and graphics work, especially when it came to developing systems for native applications. My goal in open sourcing the game engine is to provide greater access to learning and developing an application. At the moment, I actively mentor and support anyone who wants to contribute.

                            The main goal of developing the simple rasteriser was to learn the fundamental ideas involved in drawing pixels as well as how I could organise a basic rendering framework.
